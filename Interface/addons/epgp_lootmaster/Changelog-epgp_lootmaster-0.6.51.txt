- Big change to the current equipment list. Now showing all items that correspond to a Token. So we're now showing up to 5 items on the master looter interface per candidate. Besides that now also the difference in itemlevel compared to the current item is displayed.
- Another fix - though shotgun style - attempt for the EP/GP/PR ratings not showing for xrealm candidates.
- Also added the tool to the repos for generating the token lookup array

Ambiguate seriously broken. RealmNames with spaces or dashes in them seriously break functionality. Created a local patch for Ambiguate to filter out spaces and dashes

Fixed a few bugs with many thanks to Jyrden for taking some time to test a few things! note to self: cross-realm addon whispers without having a connected realms is no-go.

it seems Ambiguate all removes the servername, while we actually do want it...

Built-in wow client function UnitInRaid, UnitInParty, UnitClass, UnitIsUnit etc don't support full player names that include the servername. Created an overload that always calls Ambiguate first and handled all the other cases that might break because of the full names

Possible fix for crossrealm groups by always using the full player name behind the scenes. Only on the grid will we use the Ambiguate to remove the local RealmName
