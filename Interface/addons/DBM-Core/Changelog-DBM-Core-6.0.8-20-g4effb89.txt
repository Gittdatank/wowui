subversion:
	- Omega via svn r11999: Also add the updated hotfix timers in. Since i killed fight before hotfix this week, I cannot verify them other than just match blizzards notes. Nor can I add first timers (for when phase starts) since my logs clearly do not match the hotfix notes. I'll get the first timers and such next week reset probably
	- Omega via svn r11998: Margok. Even smarter range finder. Only force the 35 yard range on non tanks if the tank failed to get far enough away, else, show branded even if mark is active.
	Translation
	If a tank has mark of chaos and is LESS than 35 yards away from the raid, priority is
	mark of chaos > branded
	If tank has mark of chaos and is greater than 35 yards away (ie the tank isn't terrible)
	branded > mark of chaos
	If no mark of chaos is out at all, then obviously
	branded
	
	Also, range frame improvements ton twin ogron too for pulverize
	Disable useless tank warning
	Add arcane buff the bosses pass back and forth to twin ogron too.
	Disable arcane volatility CD timer. Too variable, too useless
	
	Lastly, added balls timer (when possible) to karogh
	- Omega via svn r11997: Rangef rame improvements for mythic
	- Omega via svn r11996: Push two quick fixes
	- Omega via svn r11995: Increase scan time a LOT more. they spawn REALLY slow. i think combat event happens like 10 seconds before they are actually targetable, which is likely the problem. Support marking up to 8 of them at once, instead of just 4, in case you shatter both at once into 8 motes.
	- Omega via svn r11994: Add crystal barrage yell for non LFR difficulties
	- Omega via svn r11993: Follow BW example and include jump distance on top of stack count. May tweak formatting some but we'll see if this is understood enough.
	- Omega via svn r11992: Drov Fixes Fix sweeper timer on Kargath, it's different on live than it was on beta. Add countdown for transition on Margok.
	- Omega via svn r11991: Add 3rd countdown for arcane debuff on twin ogron Fixed option default for roar on twin ogron to not announce for those it doesn't impact. Fixed FIRST impale timer on kargath Removed useless filler warning on Kargath
	- nbluewiz via svn r11990: # Nyami : timer fix. / # Ragewing : add GTFO. / # Terongor : Fixate warning on by default. (on beta realm, this boss has multiple Inferno spawn, so warning spammy. but on live, only one Infernot spawn, no reason to disable warning by default.)
	- Omega via svn r11989: Fix rangecheck issue
	- Omega via svn r11988: sizes
	- Omega via svn r11987: Add option to hide Garrison Toasts in combat
	- Omega via svn r11986: Fix bug with mark of chaos, fort not having target name in taunt warning Fix a bug where the taunt warning was TOO early and resulted in debuff going on taunting tank. If you taunt the boss early enough in CAST_START he'll put it on you. so 1 sec delay to correct super reactive shira's from taunting TOO early.
	- Omega via svn r11985: Fix guild messages still not returning correct difficulty
	- Omega via svn r11984: fix countdown voice to match impale timer change
	- ultrashining via svn r11983: zhTW update
	- Omega via svn r11982: mod:SetMinSyncRevision(11969) on world bosses
	- Omega via svn r11981: Fix trash spam.
	- Omega via svn r11980: Inc the alpha
