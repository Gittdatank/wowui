subversion:
	- Omega via svn r11992: Drov Fixes Fix sweeper timer on Kargath, it's different on live than it was on beta. Add countdown for transition on Margok.
	- Omega via svn r11991: Add 3rd countdown for arcane debuff on twin ogron Fixed option default for roar on twin ogron to not announce for those it doesn't impact. Fixed FIRST impale timer on kargath Removed useless filler warning on Kargath
	- nbluewiz via svn r11990: # Nyami : timer fix. / # Ragewing : add GTFO. / # Terongor : Fixate warning on by default. (on beta realm, this boss has multiple Inferno spawn, so warning spammy. but on live, only one Infernot spawn, no reason to disable warning by default.)
	- Omega via svn r11989: Fix rangecheck issue
	- Omega via svn r11988: sizes
	- Omega via svn r11987: Add option to hide Garrison Toasts in combat
	- Omega via svn r11986: Fix bug with mark of chaos, fort not having target name in taunt warning Fix a bug where the taunt warning was TOO early and resulted in debuff going on taunting tank. If you taunt the boss early enough in CAST_START he'll put it on you. so 1 sec delay to correct super reactive shira's from taunting TOO early.
	- Omega via svn r11985: Fix guild messages still not returning correct difficulty
	- Omega via svn r11984: fix countdown voice to match impale timer change
	- ultrashining via svn r11983: zhTW update
	- Omega via svn r11982: mod:SetMinSyncRevision(11969) on world bosses
	- Omega via svn r11981: Fix trash spam.
	- Omega via svn r11980: Inc the alpha
