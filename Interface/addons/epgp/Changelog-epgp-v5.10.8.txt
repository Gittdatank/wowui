mackatack:
	- Now using AceHook to hook the GiveMasterLoot function, instead or hooking it manually.
	- Made the changes Alkis proposed, added some comments and a thorough unit test to test all the situations that might occur. Wiping the tables on LOOT_CLOSED is not needed since the other event clear the tables themselves.
	- Sometimes the loot message is called before the LOOT_SLOT_CLEARED event. An extra lookup table has been added to make sure we're not duplicating the loot message.
	- Fixed a bug where the library couldn't always detect class-only items. Now scanning all the lines on a tooltip, this has been tried and tested in EPGPLootmaster.
	- Changed some debug output.
	- Fixed some trailing spaces and syntax here and there.
	- Simplified the patch for 'the player out of range while distributing master loot' bug. Also using less tables now.
	- Patch to fix a blizzard bug where the master looter doesn't receive a 'Player X receives Item Y.' message when the receiving player is out of range of the master looter. This patch caches the looting slots and traps the messages that trigger when a loot slot gets cleared. If after a specified period of time the master looter still doesn't receive a loot message this patch will emulate that message, so other addons such as EPGPLootmaster, headcount etc etc keep functioning.

mackatack:
	- Tiny bugfix for LibGearPoints-1.0, proper checking if itemLink is not null.
evlogimenos:
	- Close the zip file after finishing writing it.
	- Make labels a list of labels not just a string otherwise we end up with a bunch of single character labels.
	- Fix performance regression when checking for remaining pending notes. This makes the O(N) (N is number of guild members) operation to O(1).
	This fixes issue 372.
	- Rewrite make-release.sh to python. This allows easier building of releases from windows (if svn commandline is installed) and make the script do a tad more and a tad better.

	- Pull utility function out and use it in make-curseforge-localizations.py.

mackatack:
	- Initial import of LibRPC-1.0, implemented most of the comments on codereview. CallbackHandler wasn't an option because it always included the methodname in the function args, which would break most functions. LibDebug (if present) is also handling all the debug information for this lib.

evlogimenos:
	- Make the sizer the same style as the LibDebugFrame's. Also fix the position of the buttons to not be so close to the border.
	- Change the tile sizes to make the border less round. Also make the sizer texture AceGUI style.
	- Add min sizes to avoid making the window look like crap.
mackatack:

	- Move EnableDebugging where we check the version.
	- Change select(3, str:find(...)) to str:match() instead. Simpler more readable code.
	- Make announces more granular.
	This fixes issue 296.
	- Streamline the SetEnabled function for each module. Also make sure we only call module:Enable once on startup as needed.
	This is part of issue 362.

	- Do not show the EPGPFrame if not in guild.
	- Give modules some prototype functions and remove all the auxiliary code from epgp_options.lua.
	This is part of the fix for issue 362.

	- Make the log window resizable.
	This fixes issue 336.
	- Really fix issue 369.
	- Fix importing with different BaseGP.
	This fixes issue 369.

	- Remove lootmaster localizations until those strings are finalized.

	This fixes issue 366.
	- Implement resumable recurring award after a reloadUI or client relog.
	This fixes issue 289.
	- Merge change 1071 (fix to issue 365) from the epgp-5.3.1 branch.
	- Avoid writing notes at the same time if we have a recurring ticker running.
	- Move options to epgp_options since it is just another file for the core addon.
	- Remove trailing whitespace.
	- Set svn:eol-style=native on all text files.
	- Make options have their own options stanza. This separates module configuration so that it becomes more maintainable.
	An unfortunate effect is the needed rewording of most of the descriptions.
	
	This closes issue r362.
	- Fix bad interaction with svn:externals. Patch submitted to rietveld for inclusion:
	http://code.google.com/p/rietveld/issues/detail?id=100
	- Add codereview.py to drive codereviews out of the repository.
	Please see: http://code.google.com/p/rietveld/wiki/CodeReviewHelp
	and: http://codereview.appspot.com/use_uploadpy
	- Move localization files in their own directory.
	- Address comments for LibLootNotify-1.0. It now passes the itemlink instead of the itemID.
	- Remove a confusing comment.
	- Move version into epgp.lua so that other modules can use it.
	This fixes issue 360.
	- Split loot notification and CHAT_MSG_LOG parsing into its own library and remove that code from loot.lua.
	This fixes 353.
	- Add LibItemUtils-1.0 to the toc.
mackatack:
	- Removed the LibBabble stuff since that's now in the LibItemUtils
evlogimenos:
	- Fix the error strings on the library. Also change the links to item:XXXX instead of Hitem:XXXX since the 'H' is not needed.
mackatack:
	- Merged in the epgp-5-lootmaster branch, since branches seem to mess with our brainzzzz...
	- added AceSerializer-3.0 to the toc file
	- Added debug.xml to the epgp.toc and added debug.xml to svn:ignore. This is for local testing/debugging purposes.
evlogimenos:
	- Do not call callbacks immediately because that leads to confusing behaviour. The user expects a call after this function returns, but we call it before for the items we find in the cache and after for the ones we are missing. We would rather be consistent and call all callbacks from our OnUpdate handler later on.
	- Fix the item cacher to try harder and simpler. Now there is only a global timeout and a ticker. We retry every 1 second for 30 seconds before we give up on the itemcache. Each time we get something new, we extend the trying period to current time + 30 seconds.
	- Merge from epgp-5-lootmaster branch.
mackatack:
	- Added LibSerializer-3.0 to the externals
evlogimenos:
	- Actually remove the deformat code :-/
	- Add LibItemUtils-1.0 to trunk, replacing its deformat code with with Deformat-2.0.
	- Add Deformat library and remove local deformat from the code. This is part of issue 351.
	- Update localizations.
	- Remove dependency from Beautiful soup. Now this can run on any standard python installation. Woohoo!!!
	- Add extra logging when writing a file.
	- Add a script to fetch and wrap up all non-enUS localizations from curseforge so that we do not have to do this by hand each time.
	- Export only non-zero EP and non-base_gp GP members. Also make import aware of this change so that it resets missing people from the list to 0 EP, BaseGP GP on import.
	This fixes issue 349.
	- Fix the empty list problem on login when there are: k * 101 + 1 members in a guild.
	- Apparently this was not commited. The tagged 5.3 release has it though.
	- Fix issue 343. Whisper mod now disables announces properly when disabled.
	- Fix text typo.
	- Remove the snapshot functionality and the automatic snapshot on logout. Add import/export buttons to the log window and add popups to facilitate this from the webapp.
	- Put global configuration table up in the file so that comparator functions can reference it.
	- Fix whisper message to output properly. Also move expose the announce function to be used by other modules, like the whisper module and also make the whisper module announce opening of whispers when recurring awards start as well.
	This fixes 338.
	- Update localizations and fix chinese localization loading.
	- Put all guild info variables in their own table.
	- Simplify global configuration parsing code.
	- Return the current contents of the note after a SetNote call.
	- Adding some debugging information for main addon.
	- Add tiered console output support. Now EPGP has :Debug, :Info, :Warning and :Error to output to the console. Everything from :Info and above should be localized. Debug doesn't have to be. Also added a function to :SetConsoleLevel(INFO|DEBUG|WARNING|ERROR) to set the minimum console output level.
	This fixes issue 335.
	- Fix the way we handle the guild info text. When part of the epgp stanza is not there, assume the default value. Also add a function that edits the guild info text as appropriate to save the variables.
	This fixes issue 334.
	- Remove the hack that adds 2 more rows than they can fit. The window apparently changes size after it is shown for the first time so this problem should really be fixed in another way.
	In any case this fixes 333.
	- Fix options after module renaming. This fixes issue 331.
	- Fix standby awards. This fixes issue 330.
	- Do not check non-existing variables to ignore loot events. This fixes issue 326.
	- Properly escape all non-ascii characters.
	- Temporary fix to allow disabling/enabling the automatic boss kill module if it is hooked on DBM detection.
	- Add Latin American Spanish localization.
	- Update localizations.
	- Make module toggles toggle the module itself.
	- Change module references to be inline with the new module names.
	- Rename modules.
	- Pass the name of the boss instead of the module that detected the kill.
	- Use the DBM api if available to track boss kills. This fixes issue 319.
	- Break the update text into 2 lines and make it update properly on first show.
	- Fix computation of decay to correctly decay and floor the results. This fixes issue 320.
	- Add support for a guildwide standby award modifier. This fixes issue 219. Patch provided by Terry Michaels.
	- Fix issue 314. LibGuildStorage was never moved out of an uninitialized state causing it to emit GuildNoteChanged events on almost each frame update.
	Next step is to profile GuildNoteChanged events to see why they are taking so much CPU.
	- Fix alt lists from growing indefinitely. This fixes issue 314.
	- Fix argument escaping when uploading a new release archive.
	- Rewrite LibGuildStorage into a state machine that writes back its state lazily. This fixes issue 308.
	- Add Spanish and French translations.

	- Add Archavon. This fixes issue 303.
	- Fix a problem where a player that is removed from the guild causes corruption of data when his/her EPGP changes before a ReloadUI() happens. This fixes issue 302.
	- Output ignored officer notes on demand. Add a button in the configuration to do this. This effectively fixes issue 278.
	- Fix some bugs with automatic boss tracking since the implementation didn't work (it looks like I committed an unfinished part). This fixes issue 154.
	- Add missing string. Part of issue 154.
	- Implement automatic boss death detection. This doesn't work on multiboss fights like Four Horsemen. This fixes issue 154.
	- Do not change state if SetNote is called on a member we do not know of. This fixes issue 291.
	- Register the first GuildRoster() to happen after PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD. Also guard for cases where GetNumGuildMembers() returns 0 and perform the call again to eliminate spurious warnings. This fixes issue 287.
	- Do not add items to the loot queue of awards if a member is not able to credit those GP. This fixes issue 286.
	- Fix PR display to not print scientific notation when pr > 9999. This fixes issue 284.
	- Add a cache of last award amounts made and auto-fill when the same award is chosen through the single or mass EP award frame. This fixes issue 256.
	- Improve visualization of people below MinEP. This fixes issue 262.
	- Clean up popup code. Use Button:Click to simplify some functions as well.
	- Add alert icon to officer note warning popup. Also make it accept on enter. This fixes issue 282.
	- Add ChatThrottleLib support if available. This fixes issue 279.
	- Make sidepanels close when the main frame is hidden. This fixes issue 281.
	- Fix snapshot saves all the officer notes from the cache since GuildRosterInfo is not available during logout. Alos dump and restore on rollback the guild info part of the settings. This fixes 277.
	- Update the right member's EP or GP through the side frame even after a scholl up or down.
	This fixes issue 276.
	- Reject invalid officer notes and print an error to the user. These notes were making the epgp cache break in all sorts of ways.
	This fixes issue 267.
	- Remove some debugging output.
	- Fix auto-fill on manual GPs. This is issue 274.
	- Return the actual string instead of nil when an item has a single GP value. This fixes issue 274.
	- Add a count of members in the award list in the status bar.
	- Add a status bar to the bottom of the standings to display if we are looking at a raid or the guild, decay, minep and basegp.
	This fixes issue 272.
	- Remove the help text from the GP dropdown and add the tooltip instead. This fixes issue 270.
	- Make manual GP fill in `X or Y` text for items that have multiple values.
	This fixes issue 269.
	- Stop storing a list of action buttons and give an event to register to if the buttons chose so.
	- Fix thinko. When we do mass updates we can continue updating stuff even if the state is LOCAL_PENDING.
	- Fix so that people that cannot change EPGP have their buttons disabled. Also fix the wrong reenabling of buttons while the guild note cache is in an inconsistent state.
	- Fix thinko and add some documentation about the states.
	- Lock down UI actions when a remote client is doing an update. This fixes issue 247.
	- ProtectActionButtons when we know we have changes pending the cache to avoid data corruption. Also stop calling GuildRoster() a zillion times when we give a mass award. This possibly fixes issue 261.
	- Add a redo button to the log.
	Make EPGP automatically backup the officer notes on logout or reloadUI.
	
	Add a button in the configuration to rollback to the last
	backup. Because of the redo queue the state of the personal log is
	also retained.
	
	This fixes issues 254 and 195.
	- Remove debug code. Refactor the code to be more readbale, more generic, and shorter. Also fix a bug: There are multiple popup frames. We save references to UIObjects so in the OnHide function when we restore the anchors we always restore the anchors of the first frame that popped up and got backed up, even if we are in another popup. This is fixed by doing a backup for each popup frame we see for the first time.
	- Add a convinience debugging function call for testing the popup and lootqueue.
	- Remove trailing semicolon.
d43m0n:
	- Further modifications to make the popup patch more resilient. This fixes  issue 251 .
	- This patch resolves the popup components alignement issue.
evlogimenos:
	- Override raid and party announces and send them to the raid if the EPGP master is not in party or in raid respectively.
	This fixes issue 245.
	- Fix problem with officer note pointing to itself. Fix issue with names that are not in the basic ascii character set. Also update alt data when someone was an alt but stopped being one.
	This effectively fixes issue 257.
	- Fix version in development versions once and forall.
	- Add a whisper feature for members on standby.
	For this to work the EPGP officer should be in raid and the
	auto-whisper feature should be enabled. In this mode the addon
	interprets incoming whispers. If 'epgp standby' is received the sender
	is added to the award list.  If 'epgp standby <name>' is received then
	<name> is added to the award list.  After each award to the raid the
	extra people are awarded the same EP. They are also removed from the
	list and they are whispered the EP they received and also the fact
	that they have been removed from the list. At this point, from here to
	the next award they need to readd themselves to it.
	
	This fixes issue 217.
	- Fix error when pressing enter on a GP popup. This fixes issue 253.
	- Fix tooltip problems. Apparently AceHook:HookScript calls the original script automatically now. This fixes issue 209.

	- Improve the way we handle the version in releases so that the dev versions have proper versions reported even if they live in different directories.
	- Stop recurring awards when leaving a raid. This fixes issue 243.

	- Fix issue 231. /epgp now toggles the epgp frame, and /epgp config opens the configuration menu.
	- Add T7 and T7 heroic armor tokens.
	- Fix automatic loot tracking to work in raids.
	- Fix a critical bug with decay and reset.
	- Add missing documentation on callbacks fired.

	- Fix issue 210. strftime on windows is different than the one on the mac so %F %R doesn't really work for windows.
	- Stop using Deformat-2.0. Implement deformat on our own it is not that hard.
	- Fix issue 207. Guild information text was not being parsed properly.
	- Fix issue 208. This adds GP to greens and blues.
	- Fix font issues.

	- Some string fixes and a function cleanup. Add announces for recurring awards.
	- Really set disabled state.
	- Start with all modules in a disabled state. When the main addon is enabled, establish a timer to check when GetGuildInfo("player") will actually return the guild name. Once that is available, we set the database profile to the guild name and enable all modules.
	- Only create the frame once.
	- Check if the EPGPFrame exists or not.
	- Localization fixes.
	- Adjust size of the log frame a bit.

evlogimenos:
	- Implement fix for Issue 72. The new formula for GP computation is:
	GP = 0.483 * 2 ^ (200 / 26) * multiplier
	
	This means that for an epic chestpiece of ilvl 200 the GP is 100. For
	every 26 ilvls higher the GP price doubles. Also the multipliers have
	changed as follows:
	
	Head/Legs/Chest: 1
	Shoulder/Waist/Feet/Trinket: .75
	Ring/Cloak/Wrist: .5
	Wand/Relic/Idol/Totem: .5
	Main hand weapons: 1.5
	Offhand weapons: 0.5
	
	Some items have 2 multipliers and they are used in certain exceptions:
	
	2h weapon: 2 or 1
	  * 1 if it goes as an OH to a TG warrior or to a hunter, 2 otherwise
	1h weapon: 1.5 or 0.5
	  * 0.5 if it goes as a MH or to a hunter or a tanking warrior, 1.5 otherwise
	ranged weapon: 1.5 or 0.5
	  * 1.5 if it goes to a hunter, 0.5 otherwise
	shield: 1.5 or 0.5
	  * 1.5 if is a tanking shield, 0.5 otherwise
