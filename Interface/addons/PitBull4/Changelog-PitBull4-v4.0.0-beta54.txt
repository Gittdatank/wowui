Tagging as v4.0.0-beta54


--------------------

Kyle Buller:
	- FaderModule: correct the Aura module check so the alpha is updated again
	- Anchor indicators to the bar directly unless there is an icon set, in which case anchor to the fg/bg texture as done previously. Also update the layout when setting an icon to make sure textures are corrected on always shown bars. Hopefully fixes #1076 once and for all.
	- Aura: update Priest filtered spell (Echo of Light, Power Infusion, Power Word: Solace, Spectral Guise, Void Tendril)
	- FaderModule: don't error if the Aura module isn't found and update comments to reference ticket 1084
